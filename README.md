# Installing Xamarin on a mac

Download and install Xamarin
Download and install Xamarin.mac (I had to use 
    http://download.xamarin.com/XamarinforMac/Mac/xamarin.mac-1.10.0.18.pkg, not the 
    'Recommended Download'). This avoids licensing issues. If you see a window asking you 
    to enter the Activation Key, then make sure to download via the link above)
Then follow the steps at the top of this document.
