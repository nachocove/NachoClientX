plistlib.py is included in standard python distribution starting in 2.6.
However, the version in 2.6 / 2.7 does not support binary plist files.
This (resolved) bug tracks this issue:

http://bugs.python.org/issue14455

Since Info.plist is binary XML, we download a newer version mentioned in
the bug:

http://bugs.python.org/file25075/plistlib.py

We need this feature because iOS Info.plist is in binary format.
