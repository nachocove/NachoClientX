Parse iOS SDK requires linking against Facebook SDK. We did is:

1. Download the Mac Facebook SDK .pkg.
2. Install it on a Mac.
3. Rename the Facebook framework to libFacebook.a.

This directory keeps the original .pkg and the installed SDK framework folder for reference.

The SDK can be found in:

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/

Note that we only need this for linking. No API is actually used. So, we will not actively update the library.
