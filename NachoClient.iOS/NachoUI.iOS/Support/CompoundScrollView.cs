    // A compound scroll view is a scroll view that contains other scroll views

    // In the mail app there are several places where we want a scrolling view that includes something
    // static like headers, and then includes a UIWebView.  We want the headers and the webview to all scroll
    // together.  But of course UIWebView alread is a UIScrollView, so it takes some trickery to disable the
    // scrolling of UIWebView while also allowing UIWebView to optimize its rendering such that only things on
    // screen are drawn.
    //
    // This class is a generic implementation that supports positioning and adjusting inner scroll views according to
    // their position in the set of views and the scroll position of the outer scroll view.
