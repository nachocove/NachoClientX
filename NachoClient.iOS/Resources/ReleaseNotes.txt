Nacho Mail 2.0 Beta Release Notes

This version of Nacho Mail adds support for multiple accounts and for most types of email servers (IMAP and ActiveSync).

In the case of certain servers the user may experience limited calendar functionality, although this will affect a limited set of users. Calendars are shared across all accounts, allowing users to see events from multiple accounts as well as from the devices themselves.
